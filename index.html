          <p class="top-text">My love affair with Blizzard started with StarCraft. I started out watching a friend play matches on their computer. I learned that I loved the strategy and difficulty of playing with others from around the world. When I finally bought the game for myself, I found myself immersed in the story. Warcraft, World of Warcraft and the Diablo series followed. I stepped away from PC videogames in favor of console games. I didn't think much of games on console until another friend asked if I wanted to hang out and play Overwatch. Even though I didn't play a lot of first person shooters, I found myself drawn to the team based strategy of the game. I bought my own copy less than 12 hours later.</p>

          <p class="text-top">Overwatch is a team based shooter where two teams of six look to either capture control points or escort (or stop) a vehicle while battling the other team for control. The game doesn't have an explicit story line; the game lore is told through animated shorts and character voice line cues. The hero line up features tank, damage and healing characters. The tanks are designed to take large amounts of damage and lead the charge. Damage characters cause large amounts of damage and have little HP. Healer characters have the ability to protect teammates through healing and other defensive capabilities. A well-rounded team is more likely to win matches, and different heroes are better suited for different maps. There are currently 29 characters and 19 maps, with additional arcade and build-your-own-game modes.</p>

        <h2>D.Va</h2>

          <p>D.Va is my tank main. She is super mobile, and will lose her mech before she dies, giving the player an opportunity to do enough damage to call another mech. This is very useful tool when the other team does a ton of damage. I love flanking the enemy and sneaking behind them to release her Ultimate, the D.Va Bomb!</p>

          <p>Lucio is my healing main. He is a speedy, mobile healer who can ride on walls and either heals or speeds up his teammates using a passive ability with a 12 meter area of effect. He is also able to "boop" characters with a close range weapon meant to bounce back enemies, sometimes resulting in an environmental kill. I love using his ultimate abilty, Sound Barrier, to provide temporary shielding to teammates during the other team's ultimate ability.</p>

        <h2>Symmetra</h2>
          <img class='character' src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Overwatch-symmetra.jpg?fit=1680%2C945&strip=all" alt="https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1597482/overwatch-symmetra.jpg?w=736&e=8d3b2c4e1b0524c7bb0bfedd58926177">
          <p>Symmetra is my main damage character. She can place up to three laser turrets at a time that do damage and slow enemies. She also boasts a teleporter ability that allows her to access hard-to-reach places. Her main weapon, a laser beam, charges when it comes into contact with shields or enemies. It has a special ability that reloads ammo when placed against a shield. I love using her turrets to attack an ememy from behind while simultaneously attacking them with my main wepon in front.</p>
